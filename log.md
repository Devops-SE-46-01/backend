# Aslab CRUD Feature Implementation Log

## Date: April 16, 2025

### Overview
Implemented a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing Assistant Laboratory (Aslab) records based on the migration file: `2025_04_16_153346_create_aslabs_table.php`.

### Files Created/Modified

#### Models
1. Created `app/Models/Aslab.php`
   - Implemented Aslab model with fillable properties for name, image, position, and social_media

#### Controllers
2. Created `app/Http/Controllers/AslabController.php`
   - Implemented full CRUD operations
   - Added image upload handling with validation
   - Added form validation for all fields

#### Routes
3. Modified `routes/web.php`
   - Added resource route for Aslab within the authenticated routes group

#### Views
4. Created view files:
   - `resources/views/aslab/index.blade.php` - List all aslabs with actions
   - `resources/views/aslab/create.blade.php` - Form to create new aslab
   - `resources/views/aslab/edit.blade.php` - Form to update existing aslab
   - `resources/views/aslab/show.blade.php` - Detailed view of aslab information

### Features Implemented
- Complete CRUD operations for Aslab records
- Form validation for all input fields
- Image upload functionality with file validation
- Responsive layouts for all views
- Confirmation dialogs for delete operations
- Proper error handling and success messages
- Automatic image deletion when updating or deleting records

### Database Schema
The Aslab model contains:
- `id`: Primary key, auto-incremented
- `name`: String, required
- `image`: String, nullable (stores file path)
- `position`: String, required
- `social_media`: String, nullable
- `created_at`: Timestamp, automatically managed
- `updated_at`: Timestamp, automatically managed

### Next Steps
1. Create symbolic link for storage using `php artisan storage:link`
2. Implement API endpoints for aslab data if needed
3. Add authorization checks for admin-only access
4. Consider adding pagination if the list grows large

### Notes
- Image files are stored in `storage/app/public/aslab_images/` directory
- Proper image file validation ensures only jpg, png, jpeg and gif images under 2MB are allowed
